# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A **Movie Recommender System** built using **Python** that suggests movies to users based on similarity between movies and user preferences. This project demonstrates the practical application of **machine learning concepts**, data preprocessing, and recommendation algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Recommends movies based on user-selected input
- Uses similarity measures to find related movies
- Handles data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation
- Beginner-friendly ML project with real-world use case

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Movie data is loaded and cleaned using **Pandas**
2. Relevant features are extracted and transformed
3. A similarity matrix is created using techniques such as:
   - Cosine Similarity
4. Based on the selected movie, the system recommends similar movies
